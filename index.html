            <h3>Owl Academy</h3>
            <h1>About our Academy</h1>
            <br>

            <p>The main goal of Owlkids Academy is to overcome the child's fear of speaking a foreign language. We
                believe that the best solution is to create comfortable conditions for the child to learn, and the
                condition for the greatest effectiveness of lessons is individual learning, i.e. groups of one.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p> A child who knows that he will not be assessed by peers present in the class, will find it easier to
                actively participate in the lesson, and thus learn the material faster. Our teachers are people who are
                fluent in English and come from English-speaking countries. Each of them is TESOL certified and
                qualified to work with children.
            </p>

            <br>


            <p><b> None of the teachers came here by accident! </b></p>

            <br>

            <p>
                Our staff places great emphasis on learning through play. Teachers use full-body language to convey
                emotions
                and get the child to cooperate. This is known as the Total Physical Response (TPR) method. In addition,
                our
                teaching material consists of beautifully designed interactive pictures and cheerful short songs that
                perfectly complement the teacher's work. Lessons at our school last 25 minutes. This is the optimal time
                when our youngest students are able to cooperate most effectively with the teacher. However, it should
                be
                remembered that in order for learning a foreign language to be effective, lessons should be held at
                least
                twice a week. It is very necessary to consolidate already acquired vocabulary and to maintain continuity
                of
                speech.
                In addition, we believe that children should repeat material at home with their parents using audio and
                printable teaching materials available in our library.
